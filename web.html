       <h2>web:</h2>
       <p><b>The web, also known as the World Wide Web (WWW), is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that can be accessed via the internet. It is a network of billions of websites, web pages, and resources that are connected using hyperlinks and can be accessed using the internet.
       The web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, and was originally designed to facilitate the sharing of information among scientists and researchers. It has since grown to become a global network of information, entertainment, education, and communication, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</b></p>
       
       <h3>The web is built on several key technologies:</h3>
       <p>
       1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): a protocol for transferring data over the internet.<br>
       2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): a markup language for creating web pages.<br>
       3. URL (Uniform Resource Locator): a system for addressing web pages and resources<br>
       4. Web browsers: software applications that allow users to access and view web pages.<br></p>
       
       <p>The web has revolutionized the way we access and share information, communicate with each other, and conduct business. It has also enabled new forms of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and has had a profound impact on modern society.<br></p>

<h2>web page:</h2>

    <p><b>A web page is a document or information resource that is displayed on the internet and can be accessed through a web browser or other web-enabled software. It is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, and may include multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio files.</b></p>

<h3>A web page typically consists of:</h3>
<p>
1. Content: The information or message that the page is intended to convey.<br>
2. Layout: The arrangement of text, images, and other elements on the page.<br>
3. Design: The visual style and aesthetic of the page, including colors, fonts, and graphics.<br>
4. Interactivity: Features that allow users to interact with the page, such as links, forms, and buttons.<br></p>
<P>
Web pages can be static or dynamic, and may be generated by a server-side programming language such as PHP or Ruby on Rails, or by a client-side programming language such as JavaScript.</p>

<h3>example of web pages:</h3>
<p>
- Informational pages (e.g. Wikipedia articles)<br>
- E-commerce pages (e.g. Amazon product pages)<br>
- Social media profiles (e.g. Facebook profiles)<br>
- Blogs and articles (e.g. news websites)<br>
- Landing pages (e.g. marketing campaigns)<br>
- Web applications (e.g. Gmail, Google Maps)<br></p>
<p>
Web pages are an essential part of the internet and have revolutionized the way we access and share information.<br>
</p>
<h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h2>
<p><b>
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user.
HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags (< >), which are used to define different parts of a web page.</b>
</p>
  <h3>html tags:</h3>
<p>
- Headings <br>
- Paragraphs<br>
- Links<br>
- Images<br>
- Lists<br>
- Tables<br>
- Forms <br>
- Multimedia<br> </p>
<p>
HTML elements are used to wrap around content, such as text, images, and other media, to define its purpose and structure. The web browser then uses this markup to display the content in a visually appealing and functional way.
HTML has evolved over the years, with new versions and features being added to the language. The current version of HTML is HTML5, which introduces new features such as semantic elements, multimedia support, and improved error handling.
HTML is an essential skill for anyone interested in web development, and is used in conjunction with other technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript, to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
</p>
<h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h2>
<p><b>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML. It is used to separate the presentation of a document from its structure, making it easier to maintain and modify the layout and design of a website.</b></p>

<h3> css is used to define various styles for HTML elements such as:</h3>
<p>
- Colors and backgrounds<br>
- Fonts and text formatting<br>
- Layout and positioning<br>
- Padding and margins<br>
- Borders and outlines<br>
- Visual effects and animations<br></p>

<p>consists of a series of rules, known as styles, which are applied to HTML elements. These styles are defined using a set of properties and values.
 CSS can be written in an external file, embedded in the HTML document, or inline with the HTML elements.
</p>
<h3> uses of CSS include:</h3>
<p>
- Styling text and fonts<br>
- Creating layouts and grids<br>
- Designing visual effects and animations<br>
- Creating responsive designs for different devices and screen sizes<br>
- Customizing the appearance of web pages and applications<br></p>

<p>CSS is an essential tool for web development, and is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</p>
